# Brightness-Control-using-openCV


The Brightness Control using OpenCV project is an innovative application that leverages computer vision to provide users with an intuitive and contactless way of controlling screen brightness. Built using Python and OpenCV, the system captures real-time hand gestures through a webcam and dynamically adjusts the brightness level based on the distance between fingers or specific gestures. This makes it not only a practical solution but also an engaging demonstration of how computer vision can be applied to everyday tasks. The use of OpenCV ensures accurate detection and smooth tracking, while additional Python libraries like NumPy and screen_brightness_control enhance performance and functionality. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, this project eliminates the need for traditional hardware buttons or menus, giving users a futuristic experience of interacting with their devices. It’s an excellent example of how AI and image processing can be integrated to create smarter, user-friendly systems.
